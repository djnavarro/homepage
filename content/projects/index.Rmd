# Projects

## Research topics

Being employed as an academic, some proportion of my projects are research related. My research projects can be grouped into two broad categories. First, as a cognitive scientist, I am interested in how people acquire new knowledge and reason about the world; and as a mathematical psychologist my approach to studying this is to employ a mix of computational modelling and experimental work. The second broad topic I write about is methodological. What is the relationship between scientific and statistical inferences? How should researchers choose between competing theoretical models? I spend quite a lot of my time thinking about these questions. Some recent papers that I really like: 

  - Navarro, D. J. (2019). [Between the devil and the deep blue sea: Tensions between scientific judgement and statistical model selection](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/39q8y). *Computational Brain and Behavior, 2*, 28-34
  - Navarro, D. J. and Kemp, C. (2017). [None of the above: A Bayesian account of the detection of novel categories](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/szr4u). *Psychological Review, 124*, 643-677 
  - Tauber, S., Navarro, D. J., Perfors A. and Steyvers, M. (2017). [Bayesian models of cognition revisited: Setting optimality aside and letting data drive psychological theory](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/25gcm). *Psychological Review, 124*, 410-441.

## Texts and tutorials

One of my joys in life is writing tutorial articles and technical documentation for open source projects. In addition to writing the somewhat successful [learning statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com) textbook, I'm currently collaborating with Hadley Wickham to write a third edition of the [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org).


## R packages

Writing R packages is one of my favourite activities, and I have several packages at varying stages of development. Some packages are closely tied to my work: for instance, the [jaysire](https://jaysire.djnavarro.net) package provides a method for writing behavioural experiments within R that can run through a web browser. Others are general purpose tools that I find convenient, such as [workbch](https://workbch.djnavarro.net) and [slumdown](https://slumdown.djnavarro.net). The others -- [rainbowr](https://rainbowr.djnavarro.net), [asciify](https://asciify.djnavarro.net) and [jasmines](https://jasmines.djnavarro.net) -- are just for fun!

## R-Ladies Sydney

[R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) is a worldwide organisation that promotes gender diversity within the R community. The organisation is explicitly LGBTIQ friendly and trans-inclusive, and aims to provide support in across the entire spectrum of roles whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educators, or users. In collaboration with Jen Richmond, Lisa Williams, Steph Stammel I helped to co-found the [Sydney R-Ladies](https://rladiessydney.org/) chapter in 2018, and it's been one of the most rewarding professional activities I've ever been involved in.

## Other community activities 

In the past I've been an associate editor at three journals that I think highly of: *Cognitive Science*, *Behavior Research Methods*, and *Open Mind*. At the moment, however, my only editorial role is as review editor at an [obscure technical journal](https://www.sciencemag.org/).
