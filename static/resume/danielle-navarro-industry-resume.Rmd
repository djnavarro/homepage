# Some biographical detail

My Ph.D. was awarded in 2003 by the University of Adelaide, where I was appointed Lecturer in 2006, promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2009 and Associate Professor in 2013. I held multiple Australian Research Council (ARC) Fellowships from 2007-2015 and from 2016 have been Associate Professor at UNSW Sydney. 

# Coding and workflow

My code is written mostly in R, with a light sprinkle of C++ when speed is necessary. For web programming I rely on javascript HTML and CSS, focusing on libraries such as jsPsych designed specifically for my use case, and use plumber and Shiny at times when I need web applications to rely on R code. I make extensive use of Hugo and associated literate programming tools in R (blogdown, hugodown, rmarkdown etc), and have experience writing Hugo themes. My workflow was previously based around Matlab/Octave and I remain familiar with those languages; additionally I have some familiarity with Python. I've written several small R packages (caladown, jaysire, flametree etc) and have experience with standard developer tools (usethis, testthat, pkgdown etc), and am similarly comfortable working with git/GitHub and associated R tools (gert, git2r, etc). For everyday data analysis I rely on tidyverse primarily. I have a little experience with tidymodels, but my typical workflow is currently based around calling JAGS and (to a lesser extent) Stan directly to implement Bayesian data analysis.


# Communication

- wrote award winning statistics textbook
- co-authoring ggplot2 3rd ed
- open course materials, youtube videos
- summer school 
- teaching philosphy (see M&M course notes)


# Project leadership and mentoring

- successful grant funding, part of CoE 
- ran research group, lots of academic output
- supervised 8 postdocs, 12 phd students, 21 hons/masters. they all landed well
