      <description>Academic Publications One of the most venerable traditions of academic websites is to include a page drily listing the scholarly books and journal publications for which one is to be held responsible. One presumes that this tiresome practice establishes one&amp;rsquo;s credentials to one&amp;rsquo;s peers, who will dutifully stare at the wall of text and be impressed by the overwhelming boredom it inspires. To that end, on this page you can find links to selected books and papers, most of which are freely available on PsyArXiv.</description>

      <description>Projects Research topics My academic research can be grouped into two broad categories. First, as a cognitive scientist, I am interested in how people acquire new knowledge and reason about the world; and as a mathematical psychologist my approach to studying this is to employ a mix of computational modelling and experimental work. The second broad topic I write about is methodological. What is the relationship between scientific and statistical inferences?</description>

      <description>Teaching Materials An Introduction to Data Visualisation in R 
Data visualisation is a fundamental research task that is necessary in almost every field of scientific work. The human visual system is a powerful information processing tool, and in practice scientists rely heavily on figures and graphs to make sense of data they have collected. In this class I&amp;rsquo;ll provide an introduction to data visualisation using the R statistical programming language.</description>

      <description>Textbooks From 2011 to 2015 I taught an introductory statistics class at the University of Adelaide using the R statistical computing language, and wrote my own lecture notes, pitched at undergraduate psychology students. It got a little out of hand, turning into a 600 page book, which I&amp;rsquo;ve made freely available under a Creative Commons licence at https://learningstatisticswithr.com
The book covers the basics of psychological research methods, R programming, data wrangling, descriptive statistics, R graphics, orthodox and Bayesian inference, t-tests, chi-square tests, factorial ANOVA and multiple regression in a friendly (and I hope helpful) way.</description>
